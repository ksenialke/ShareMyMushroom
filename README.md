## About this project 
Came up with an idea for an app that allows people to upload and browse images of mushrooms. **But Ksenia, why exactly mushrooms?!** you may ask. Well, I was simply aiming at building an app which allows mushroom recognition, based on a photo of it. Then, after the recognition process, it would provide the user with a bunch of useful data such as whether the mushroom is edible or not, what it is actally called, where and when it grows best etc... Unfortunately, the level of my skills is not sufficient YET. So I figured that building a prototype of a simplified version of the app will do in the process of learning. But I'm definitely planning on expanding the functionality of #ShareMyMushroom.
